8. Salient Features
Continuous, Passive Authentication: Verifies user identity continuously without requiring active input.

Privacy by Design: All user data remains on the device, ensuring maximum privacy.

High Efficiency: Optimized GRU models and native code ensure minimal impact on battery life and device performance.

Detects Multiple Threat Vectors: Effective against both robotic bots (which are too perfect) and human spoofers (who are imperfect in the wrong way).

Scalable Architecture: The multi-agent design allows for easy addition of new behavioral agents (e.g., App Usage, Location) in the future.
