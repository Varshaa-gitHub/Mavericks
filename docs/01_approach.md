1. Approach and Uniqueness
Our Approach
The project addresses the need for a robust, privacy-preserving security mechanism on mobile devices. Traditional security methods often rely on static credentials (passwords, PINs) which are vulnerable to theft, or cloud-based analysis which raises privacy concerns.

Our system creates a dynamic, personalized security layer that understands a user's unique behavioral patterns to detect potential fraud, spoofing, or bot-like activity in real-time. It achieves this by building a mathematical model of the user's "normal" behavior using machine learning. An anomaly is defined as any significant deviation from this learned baseline.

What Makes It Unique
The uniqueness of this solution lies in three key principles:

Fully On-Device Processing: To guarantee user privacy, every stage—from raw data collection to model inference—is executed locally on the device. No sensitive behavioral data is ever transmitted to external servers. This also ensures low-latency detection that is independent of network connectivity.

Multi-Agent Architecture: Instead of a single, monolithic program, the system is architected as a collection of independent, specialized agents (e.g., Movement Agent, Typing Agent). These agents operate in parallel and report their findings to a central coordinator, creating a resilient and scalable system that can analyze multiple behavioral signals at once.

Context-Aware Security: The system is designed to only trigger security actions (like a re-authentication prompt) when an anomaly is detected during a sensitive operation (e.g., opening a banking app). This "just-in-time" security prevents unnecessary interruptions during casual use, solving common usability problems in continuous authentication systems.
